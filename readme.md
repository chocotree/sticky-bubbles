## how to write webpack config files in Typescript

- [a medium blog post](https://medium.com/webpack/unambiguous-webpack-config-with-typescript-8519def2cac7)

- [read webpack docs here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-languages/#typescript)

    ### conclusion ðŸ”»
    Actually, just install ts-node and change webpack.config.js to .ts file,
    and update import, export syntax, that's it!<br/>

    We can still use the original npm script like:

    <span style="color: #6a9955;">// just a basic example ðŸ‘€</span></br>
    "build": "webpack --mode production".
    
    Because we installed the ts-node package, and webpack just need that to use webpack.config.ts file!
